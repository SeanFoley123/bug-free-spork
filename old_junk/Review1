Background and Context:
Game Background
You are a blobby baby (orphan) who is trying to find your family with the help (?) of a symbiotic mushroom.
Genre: Puzzle platformer
Use a variety of fungi to traverse levels
Hang-gliding
Decomposing
Climbing
Floating like a boat
Choices you make throughout the levels determine your final fate: will you be happy or will you rule the world?

Context
We want to create a story-driven platformer with intriguing core mechanics
We want an emphasis on object-oriented programming and model-view-controller

Key Questions:
What can we add to the story to make it more interesting?
What sounds most fun?
How should we handle drowning and water interactions in general?
What can we add to the game to convey the story effectively?
What can we add to the story to make it more interesting?
Is there anything you think we should specifically avoid (from past experience, etc)?
How do you envision this?

Agenda:

We hope to get feedback on story and some technical aspects as well as get more input and possible direction for the project.
We will talk about background/concept first to frame the discussion, and demonstrating what we have so far will hopefully help the audience understand some of the basics of our game. We will then ask our key questions, starting with ones to understand how our idea comes across and what might be some larger design elements to incorporate/modify/edit out, and narrowing down to specific technical questions. This order may change depending on the questions our audience has for us and the overall direction of the discussion.
