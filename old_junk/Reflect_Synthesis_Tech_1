Reflection and Synthesis: Tech Review 1

Feedback Synthesis:
Main feedback: 
-Avoid trying to implement too many features
-Water could be handled by either instant death or just a slow movement to start
-Have mechanics evolve over time and a final stage where the mechanics all come together
-Focus either on implementing several features or puzzle design, doing both might be too much
-Shooting spores should be simple (or at least have the option to be simple)

Going forward, we will identify the key features and figure out what order makes the most sense for implementation so that if we have time, we can expand, but will be fine otherwise. We will try out some of the suggestions for how the mechanics should behave, possibly in a series of short trial levels. 

New questions:
-Which features/abilities are the most important to create good puzzles?
-What controller interaction makes the most intuitive sense for each ability?

Process Reflection:

We entered this technical review with a fairly vague plan, evidenced in part by our lack of an agenda-setting slide, something most of the other groups had. However, we had discussed our plan ahead of time, and we knew the general sense of what we wanted from the review. We didn't have any pressing technical questions, so quite a bit of our time was spent introducing the audience to our idea and explaining some of the nuances of story and gameplay we wanted. This led to brainstorming as a class, which was fun and helpful. Because of how well this played out, I am inclined to believe that we provided enough context to intrigue them and make their suggestions useful.

Talking to the group helped us refine our idea of an MVP based on what the audience latched onto (puzzles, corruption points, and abilities with or without the mushroom) and what they weren't as excited about (the story element was not discussed heavily). We could probably get even more out of this in the future if we stuck more closely to our questions and presented in a manner that flowed more gracefully from piece to piece, with questions scattered intermittently rather than gathered into one slide at the end. However, as an introduction, a little more guidance here was necessary.
