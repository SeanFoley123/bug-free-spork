    "Symbiosis is a game in which you play as a blobby orphan baby trying to find a family to accept it. Using powers granted to you by a mushroom symbiote, traverse levels and make decisions to meet your goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "This project uses the math, sys, and pygame libraries. Make sure these are installed before playing the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modules\n",
    "To play, run the file game_base2.py. This imports the modules Spores, LivingThings, Terrain, and Room. These contain the classes needed to run the game.\n",
    "- Spores contains the classes for the thrown spores, such as decomposition and ledge-creation.\n",
    "- Terrain contains the classes for the platforms and surfaces and obstacles.\n",
    "- LivingThings contains the classes for the player and creatures that move.\n",
    "- Room contains and constructs the levels, and imports the above modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keybindings\n",
    "Use the arrow keys to move. Spacebar throws spores. Up arrow key allows you to jump. Don't hit the enemy, try to survive!"
