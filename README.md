# Symbiosis

Symbiosis is a platform game in which you play as a blobby orphan baby trying to find a family to accept it. Using powers granted to you by a mushroom symbiote, traverse levels and make decisions to meet your goal.

## Dependencies
This project uses the math, sys, collections, numpy and pygame libraries. Make sure these are installed before playing the game.

## Modules
To play, run the file game_base2.py. This imports the modules Spores, LivingThings, Terrain, and Room. These contain the classes needed to run the game.
- Spores contains the classes for the thrown spores, such as decomposition and ledge-creation.
- Terrain contains the classes for the platforms and surfaces and obstacles.
- LivingThings contains the classes for the player and creatures that move.
- Room contains and constructs the levels, and imports the above modules.
- HUD contains classes for dialogue and stat bars
- Menu creates a menu
- Intro contains Video/cutscenes
- game_base2 displays and runs the game using a Controller and View class

## Getting Started
To download the code to run Symbiosis, open https://github.com/SeanFoley123/bug-free-spork/archive/master.zip in a browswer.

## Usage
Run from game_base2.py. This should open a pygame window, beginning with a cutscene. Press 'space' to advance through this cutscene. The game will then begin.

### Keybindings
Use the left and right arrow keys to move. Spacebar throws spores; change which type using 'e' (grows ledges) and 'q' (kills and destroys objects). The down arrow key lets you eat mushrooms to regain health. 't' allows you to talk to your sybiotic mushroom friend. 'p' brings up the pause menu. Don't hit the enemy, try to survive!

# THINGS TO DO

## Must be done ASAP

	Make the tutorial more intuitive/helpful

	Fix the whole level-traversing thing. Maybe make you able to go both ways? -- Done

	Shrink level 2 -- Done

	Ledges expire after a certain amount of time (10 seconds?) -- Done

	Only one key to switch spores

	Fix the spore-HUD thing

	Display key-bindings on menu

	Make multiple menus

	Terrain rectangles shouldn't affect movement or ledges spreading

## Would be nice

	Make more cool levels

	New spore abilities

	Implement more story

	More levels of corruption

	Make lava look dangerous/make a barrier between it and water
